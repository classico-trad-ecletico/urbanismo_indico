  abstract: >-
    One of the primary purposes of man’s shelter is protection against adverse
    or undesirable climate environments, which also includes adaptability and
    ability to mould its material content to provide comfort. Indeed, shelter is
    a basic’ requirement of human existence from physical stresses imposed by
    the environment and climate variations provide the most common set of
    stresses on homeotherrns. Adedeji (2004) argued that housing issues affect
    the life of individuals as well as that of a nation; hence both nature and
    society ascribed great importance to the role it plays to bring about human
    comfort. All over the world, urban centres are expanding by migration and
    natural population increase. This is especially true of the tropical
    countries where the proportions of urban centres are increasing fast. The
    poor population of this region is pushed into the urban centres because of
    the lure of the city. Once in the city, they face problems of inadequate of
    unavailable housing and where available, these buildings (usually mid
    latitude European styles) do not really or meet the desired need of the
    people. The other poor ones left behind in the rural areas are also faced
    with the pressure of abandoning their traditional way of life including
    their architecture in preference for imported architecture and styles. In
    the process, because of the inferiority complex, many no longer have homes.
    There is also a breakdown or loss of traditional skills in traditional house
    design.

    This open access book explores key issues and presents recent case studies
    in areas of importance for the transition to a circular model of development
    in emerging African countries that will minimize resource consumption and
    waste production. The topics covered include the development of sustainable
    housing models, energy and environmental issues in building design and
    technical systems, recycling for a sustainable future, models for
    humanitarian emergencies, and low-cost and web-based digital tools with
    applications in architecture and archaeology. The aim is to contribute to a
    necessary paradigm shift with respect to urban planning and usage of
    territories, moving from a linear urban metabolism based on the "take, make,
    dispose" approach to a circular metabolism. Such a change requires a focus
    on the relationship between the architectural, urban, and physical aspects
    of new developments, climate, and energy demand, as well as the
    identification and integration of strategies and infrastructures to achieve
    a high level of efficiency and self-sufficiency. The book will appeal to all
    with an interest in sustainable development in the African context.

  abstract: >-
    Approximately ten years ago now, several colleagues and I were discussing
    Geoffrey Parker and Lesley Smith's then recently-published volume on the
    ‘Seventeenth-Century Crisis’ when a specialist in Byzantine history told us
    that in his opinion at least, Parker, Smith, and the others who had
    contributed to their jointly-edited work had gotten it all wrong. The really
                  important
                  ‘general crisis’ in pre-modern times, he believed, had occurred not in the seventeenth century but rather in the fourteenth. As he went on to discuss the impact of climatic change, food shortages, epidemic disease, monetary fluctuations, and military operations on fourteenth-century Europe and the Middle East, I began to think about some of the great and terrible events that had occurred in East Asian history during that same century: the fall of the Kamakura Shogunate (1185–1330S) and the political turmoil of the Northern and Southern Dynasties (
                  Nambokuchō
                  ) period (1336–92) in Japan; the economic and military disasters surrounding the fall of the Mongol Yuan dynasty (1279–1368) in China; and the food shortages, ‘Japanese pirate’ (
                  wakō
                  ) raids, and civil wars that paved the way for the founding of the Yi dynasty (1392–1910) in Korea. In subsequent readings I added economic and political strife in fourteenth-century Southeast Asia, the decline of the Delhi Sultanate in India, the collapse of the Ilkhanate (1256–1335) in Persia, and the destructive rise of Timur (1336–1405) in Transoxania. Surely a case could be made, I came to think, for a 'General Crisis of the Fourteenth Century,' one much broader in scope than even our Byzantine specialist had been considering.

    The Central Cattle Pattern (CCP) is the dominant model to interpret the Iron
    Age of southern Africa. Protagonists of the CCP argue that the model can be
    traced back to the Early Iron Age, when the first farmers settled in the
    region. In this paper, I suggest that the spatial features of the CCP are
    not diagnostic, and not restricted to patrilineal, Eastern Bantu-language
    speakers. The spatial features addressed include hut shape and village
    layout, centrally positioned livestock kraals, storage pits and burial data.
    The spatial features of the CCP, when applied to Early and Middle Iron Age
    sites, are inappropriate and mimicked by other cultures.

    Architectural historian Jiat-Hwee Chang teaches at the National University
    of Singapore and studies climatic design and technoscientific knowledge. In
    this interview, he discusses the themes and places that have influenced his
    work — from his early experiences as a student of architecture and how they
    have animated his book A Genealogy of Tropical Architecture: Colonial
    Networks, Nature, and Technoscience, of 2016, to his current manuscript
    Everyday Modernism: Architecture and Society in Singapore, to be published
    in 2022. In this conversation with Anita Bakshi, Chang reflects on the
    translation of architectural knowledge into the personal, political, and
    technical spheres and brings a rich range of knowledge and experience to
    bear on important current questions of environmental justice, urban
    inequality, and climate change.

  abstract: "The final chapter of this book takes a comparative perspective on the case studies and analyses provided in the preceding papers that focused on the East African coast, North-West Africa (Morocco) and the Iberian Peninsula from the precolonial to the colonial periods. The contribution of comparative approaches to historical archaeologies is\_reviewed, while highlighting their relevance for the themes of urbanism and colonialism. The focus remains on the roles of the most important public features identified throughout the book, such as mosques, markets and streets, while offering comparative analyses of their social-spatial character and potential. The semi-public function as a component of specific spaces in otherwise residential or private buildings is analysed in detail. Reflecting on the importance of the courtyard house in Islamic towns, the social role of the courtyard is analysed with the use of space syntax on two contemporary sites at Gede, Kenya and Siyasa, Spain. The theoretical models of colonial urbanism and Islamic urbanism are discussed in reflection on their established characteristics and on the use of these concepts in urban studies and historical archaeology."

  abstract: >-
    This book offers an interdisciplinary perspective on the precolonial to
    colonial transition in an urban context, by focusing on the changing
    distribution, character and role of public spaces and buildings. The volume
    focuses on three case study regions: East African coast, North-West Africa,
    and the Iberian Peninsula. The regions are selected to provide a novel
    perspective on the socio-spatial impact of colonialism on the public life of
    urban settlements, driven by different political forces, in different
    geographical contexts and time periods. The three study areas are also
    linked by sharing several features of urban lifestyle such as the role of
    trade and the influence of religion, Islam in particular. The intertwined
    influence of socio-spatial urban characteristics on public life is presented
    on a range of case studies selected from Africa and southern Europe. The
    approaches are rooted in archaeological thinking on the built environment as
    material culture and incorporate critical interpretation of ethnographies
    and historical accounts on both the precolonial and colonial eras. This
    volume is of interest to archaeologists and researchers working in urban
    history, anthropology, and heritage

    The Arabic courtyard house has been physically and symbolically adjusted to
    serve two inseparable functions. Firstly, as a shelter (MA-AWA), providing
    the inhabitants with proper protection from unfavourable outside conditions
    (climate). Secondly, as a habitat (MASKAN), in which the inhabitants may
    comfortably satisfy their physical and emotional requirements (culture).
    Although this type of house has, to a large extent, been architecturally
    stamped with Islamic culture, its roots in fact go back into antiquity. The
    aim of this paper is to trace the origins of the Arabic house and its
    subsequent development throughout the history of Syria.

    Much of the architectural heritage on the coast of East Africa was built
    with coral limestone and today it suffers from a severe decay. Swahili
    architecture and European colonial architecture are part of this heritage.
    After many observations at sites such as Inhambane, Ilha de Moçambique and
    Ilha de Ibo, we think that the phenomenon of regeneration of soluble salts
    is the main cause of degradation of coral stone buildings. Knowledge and
    mastery of the physical and chemical phenomena in coral stone buildings are
    the basis of the preservation process. But the techniques of the past, when
    known to the restorer, can suggest the best way for the restoration and
    maintenance practices (Some topics of this theme: lime from coral - sand
    fluvial from the Ibo Island - murrapa juice, as an additive for mortar).
    Finally, the paper proposes the idea of preserving historic coastal
    settlements in an optimal equilibrium with natural environment assets.

    Blier illuminates the extraordinary architecture of the Batammaliba people
    of Western Africa, revealing these buildings as texts through which we can
    read the beliefs, psychology, traditions, and social concerns of their
    inhabitants. In doing so, she explores the role of vernacular architecture
    as an expression of culture.  "A splendid analysis of the centrality of
    architecture in the daily lives of the Batammaliba and its integral role in
    articulating social values....The story is beautifully told in the best of
    anthropological traditions."—Judith R. Blau, Contemporary Society  "A
    remarkable study....Blier's volume carries the study of African architecture
    to a qualitatively new level of scholarship. It introduces a new dimension
    whereby the architectural medium can be used to illuminate much of the
    entire belief system of any culture."—Labelle Prussin, African Arts  "In
    this excellent book Blier provides a richly detailed and searching account
    of what architecture means to the Batammaliba of northern Togo and
    Benin....The finest account I have yet read of the relations between systems
    of beliefs, ritual practices, and African aesthetics and plastic arts....The
    ethnography and basic insight should be the envy of any social
    anthropologist."—T.O. Beidelman, Man

  abstract: >-
    In recent years, our inherited architectural culture, which privileges the
    autonomy of form and the paradigmatic status of the western tradition, has
    been contested from a range of critical perspectives. In this article I
    address some of the new challenges that architectural history faces today
    and contemplate two questions with important implications for teaching
    survey courses. First, how does one make architectural history less
    Eurocentric and more cross-cultural without either naturalizing the cultural
    difference of "others" or essentializing these differences into
    incommensurable categories? Second, how does one talk about the politics of
    architecture without reducing architecture to politics?

    The British Institute in Eastern Africa promotes research into the
    archaeology, history, linguistics, and anthropology of eastern Africa,
    broadly defined. It is based in Nairobi where it maintains a library and
    research facilities. The Institute undertakes and supports research in
    countries throughout the region, from Zimbabwe to the Sudan. It is supported
    by the British Academy, and is governed by a Council, elected by its
    members, which is based in London. 


    The images in this archive comprise the image archives held at the BIEA's
    Nairobi base. They relate to archaeological excavations and reconnaissance
    at key locations in the region, including some of the BIEA's flagship
    projects at sites like Aksum, Ethiopia, and Kilwa Kisiwani, Tanzania. 


    The images are scanned from slides and photographs held in Nairobi; they
    were digitized as part of a collaboration with Aluka (now part of JStor) and
    are also available online to paid subscribers. Together the images, and
    accompanying documents, form a record of decades of research at important
    sites in the eastern African region. This includes some parts of eastern
    Africa - notably the Somali coast - which are now effectively closed to
    research, and where the sites and monuments from these pictures are almost
    certainly now destroyed.


    This archive seeks to preserve this information for future researchers, and
    to make it available beyond Nairobi.

- id: burton:1872zanzibar
  abstract: "In the preface, Burton attempts to explain why he has taken so long to publish this material, which dates back for the most part to 1858, and had been rediscovered and returned to him in 1865, but was only appeared in 1872.\_ The reasons he gives do not include what seems most likely, the renewed interest in the Nile and the East African region sparked by the Livingstone Relief expedition.\n\nPREFACE.\n\nI FEEL that the reader will expect some allusion to the circumstances which have delayed, till 1871, the publication of a journal ready to appear in 1860. \nThe following letter will explain the recovery of a long report, forwarded by me in 1857, under an address, very legibly written in ink, upon its cover, to the late Dr Norton Shaw, then Secretary Royal Geographical Society of Great Britain.\n\n'No. 9, of 1865.\n\n'General Department,\n\n\tBombay Castle, 2811 February, 1865.\n\n'To\n\n\tThe Under Secretary of State for India,\n\n\tLondon.\n\nSir,'\n\n'With reference to the packet addressed, as per margin, which was sent to you via Southampton from the Separate Department, by the Overland Mail of the 14th instant,\_ I have the honour to subjoin for your information \tcopy of a note on the subject from the Hon. W. E. Frere, dated the 5th idem.\n\t\n\n'When searching the strong box belonging to the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society yesterday I found the accompanying parcel, directed to the Secretary Royal Geographical Society, with a pencil note upon it, requesting that it might be sent to the Secretary of State, Foreign Office. From the signature in the corner, R. F. B., I conclude that it must be the manuscript he sent to Colonel Rigby at Zanzibar, and which, from some statements of Mr. Burton (to which I cannot at present refer, but of which I have a clear recollection), never reached its destination.'[1]\n\n'I have not been able to discover when or how the parcel was received, nor how the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society was to send it to the \n\tForeign Office, except through Government. I therefore send it to you, and perhaps you would send it to the Under Secretary at the India House, with the above explanation, and request that it be sent to its direction.'\n\n'I have, &c.,\n\n\t(Signed) C. RAVENSCROFT,\n\n\tActing Chief Secretary to Government.'\n\nIt is not a little curious that, as my first report upon the subject of Zanzibar was diverted from its destination, so the ' Letts' containing my excursions to Sa'adani and to Kilwa also came to temporary grief. Annexed by a skipper on the West African coast, appropriated by his widow, and exposed at a London bookseller's stall (labelled outside, `Burton Original MS. Diary in Africa'), it was accidentally left by the buyer, an English Artillery officer, in the hall of one of H. M. 's Ministers of State. Here being recognized, it was kindly and courteously returned to me. The meteorological observations made by me on the East African seaboard and at other places during the discovery of the Lakes were also, I would remark, mislaid for years, deep hidden in certain pigeonholes at Whitehall Place. May these three accidents be typical of the fate of my East African Expedition, which, so long the victim of uncontrollable circumstance, appears now, after many weary years, likely to emerge from the shadow which overcast it, and to occupy the position which I ever desired to see it conquer.\n\nThe two old documents are published with the less compunction as Zanzibar, though increasing in importance and now the head-quarters of an Admiralty Court and of two Mission-Schools, with a printing-press and other civilized \nappliances, has not of late been worked out. The best authorities are still those who appeared about a quarter of a century ago, always excepting, however, the four magnificent volumes, Baron Carl Clare von der Decken's Reisen in Ost-Afrika, in den Jahren 1859 bis 1861, which I first saw at Jerusalem: there too I had the pleasure of making acquaintance with Dr Otto Kersten, who accompanied the unfortunate traveller during the earlier portion of his peregrinations, and who has so ably and efficiently performed his part as editor. Had a certain publisher carried out his expressed intention of introducing a resume of this fine work in English dress to the British public, I should have saved myself the trouble of writing these volumes: the Reisen, however, in the original form are hardly likely to become popular. Moreover, the long interval of a decade has borne fruit : it has given me time to work out the subject, and, better still, to write with calmness and temper upon a theme of the most temper-trying nature, - chap. xii. vol. II. will explain what is meant. Finally, I have something important to say upon the subject of\_ the so-called Victoria Nyanza Lake.\n\nI had proposed to enrich the Appendix with extracts from Arab and other mediaeval authors, who have treated of Zanzibar, Island and Coast. Such an addition, however, would destroy all proportion between the book and its subject: I have therefore confined myself to notes on commerce and tariffs of prices in 1857 to 1859, to meteorological observations, and to Capt. Smee's coasting voyage, which dates from January, 1811. The latter will supply an excellent birds-eye view of those parts of the Zanzibar mainland which were not visited by the East African Expedition.\n\nRICHARD F. BURTON.\n\nLondon, Oct. 15, 1871.\n\n[1].\_ Mr. Frere's memory is unusually short. I intrusted the \nMS. to the Eurasian apothecary of the Zanzibar Consulate, and I suspected (Lake Regions of Central Africa, vol. i. chap. i.) that it bad come to an untimely end. The white population at Zanzibar had in those days a great horror of publication, and thus is easily explained how a parcel legibly addressed to the Royal Geographical Society had the honour of passing eight years in the strong box of the Bombay Branch of the Royal Asiatic Society."

    This paper outlines the debate surrounding the emergence of the first
    ‘global’ economy and discusses the role within it of Africa. First, it
    outlines the case for arguing that the Indian Ocean World (IOW) rather than
    Europe should be considered the arena in which the first global economy
    developed.   It subsequently examines the historical role of Africa within
    the IOW with particular emphasis on Africa’s contribution to the IOW global
    economy and the possible repercussions such an analysis has for the
    historiography of Africa and the wider IOW.

    Questo volume si occupa di codificare il metodo per l'esecuzione di
    operazioni di lettura delle strutture edilizie che si sono costituite in
    passato a livello di "coscienza spontanea" in una progressione di grandezze
    scalari che vanno dall'edificio, all'aggregazione di edifici, all'organismo
    urbano, al territorio. L'attenzione ai prodotti architettonici del passato è
    il campo della "tipologia processuale" che è la chiave per l'utilizzazione
    della storia nell'operare come architetti nel mondo contemporaneo.

    As the world today faces messy problems, what in some circles has been
    called global weirding, the term resilience has taken centre stage. This is
    crunch time--as we grapple with the negative effects of both climate change
    and urbanisation. Some commentators have compared the huge problems we face
    today to Oom Schalk's proverbial leopard waiting for us in the withaak's
    shade. Do we endlessly count Oom Schalk's proverbial leopard's spots? This
    is the question posed by a stellar cast of academics, researchers, and
    experts whose contributions in this text is a rallying cry for action to
    build resilience to the challenging impact of urbanisation and climate
    change. To that end, this volume gives hope about the potential for human

  abstract: >-
    The dissertation reports the results of an ethnographic investigation of
    urban Malay associate choice in the town of Kota Bharu, Kelantan, West
    Malaysia. Field data were collected using standard anthropological
    techniques of participant observation, interviewing, the collection of
    activity schedules, and genealogies. The geographical, historical, and
    demographic context of the town is described.


    Malay urbanism is rather similar to the urbanism of Indonesian middle cities
    in that it is characterized by an involutional or static character in which
    few new social forms are produced or created. It is possible to account for
    the involutional character of Malay urbanism by reference to the factors of
    land and neighbourhood as they interact with factors arising from the
    occupational structure of the town. Urban life is characterized by two
    contrasting ideologies. The ideology of work forms the basis of the system
    of urban stratification; by emphasizing the motif of pride this ideology
    makes it difficult for urbanites to form associations across categories. In
    contrast, the ideology of association emphasizes the motif of humility and
    stresses the qualities of reciprocity and balance between individuals.
    Neither ideology can be said to govern urban life. Rather, Malay urbanism is
    a synthesis of considerations arising from both systems mediated by the
    choices of individual urbanites. Through an analysis of the use of time and
    associate choice it is demonstrated that although constraints of occupation
    account for certain regularities in the data, other factors are also
    significant. The analysis of a number of cases indicates that the
    relationship between the urbanite and the urban local group is a
    particularly significant factor influencing his choices. This is further
    supported by the analysis of a number of "special time" events which most
    frequently take place among members of the local groups and often emphasize
    solidarity among the members.


    The analysis of data from several areas of the town indicates the importance
    of land ownership as a factor defining membership in the local group. The
    local group is occupationally heterogeneous and considerations arising from
    the ideology of stratification make the possibility of dissolution
    potentially high. It is the joint interest in land which forms the basis for
    associations transcending these divisive tendencies. When, however,
    urbanites lose control over their land, the neighbourhood and the local
    group dissolve and urbanites search elsewhere for a part of the town where
    they can settle and create ties with a new set of neighbours, joining a new
    local group. Rather than creating new social forms to meet the changed
    conditions of the neighbourhood, they recreate the patterns to which they
    are accustomed in another part of the town. As a result of this, the pattern
    of urbanism remains unchanged and continues to have an involutional or
    static character.


    These findings challenge the conclusion of Provencher that Malay urbanism is
    a recreation and intensification of rural patterns. It is found that
    although the form and expression of reciprocity may be similar in town and
    village, in the village reciprocity is sustained by the recognition of
    similarities, whereas in the city it-is sustained by the recognition of
    differences. While Malay urbanism is different from rural life, it is also
    distinguished from the dynamic urbanism associated with European towns in
    their early stages in which the creation of new forms of social organization
    was the rule. It is the factors of land and neighbourhood which account for
    the transitional, involutional character of Malay urbanism.


    The dissertation epilogue describes an application of the thesis to a
    specific problem in national development policy planning.

    The primary era of this study - the twentieth century - symbolizes the peak
    of the colonial rule and its total decline, as well as the rise of the new
    nation state of India. The processes that have been labeled 'westernization'
    and 'modernization' radically changed middle-class Indian life during the
    century. This book describes and explains the various technological,
    political and social developments that shaped one building type - the
    bungalow - contemporaneous to the development of modern Indian history
    during the period of British rule and its subsequent aftermath. Drawing on
    their own physical and photographic documentation, and building on previous
    work by Anthony King and the Desais, the authors show the evolution of the
    bungalow's architecture from a one storey building with a verandah to the
    assortment of house-forms and their regional variants that are derived from
    the bungalow. Moreover, the study correlates changes in society with
    architectural consequences in the plans and aesthetics of the bungalow. It
    also examines more generally what it meant to be modern in Indian society as
    the twentieth century evolved.

    The great medieval settlement of Angkor in Cambodia [9th–16th centuries
    Common Era (CE)] has for many years been understood as a “hydraulic city,”
    an urban complex defined, sustained, and ultimately overwhelmed by a complex
    water management network. Since the 1980s that view has been disputed, but
    the debate has remained unresolved because of insufficient data on the
    landscape beyond the great temples: the broader context of the monumental
    remains was only partially understood and had not been adequately mapped.
    Since the 1990s, French, Australian, and Cambodian teams have sought to
    address this empirical deficit through archaeological mapping projects by
    using traditional methods such as ground survey in conjunction with advanced
    radar remote-sensing applications in partnership with the National
    Aeronautics and Space Administration (NASA)/Jet Propulsion Laboratory (JPL).
    Here we present a major outcome of that research: a comprehensive
    archaeological map of greater Angkor, covering nearly 3,000 km2, prepared by
    the Greater Angkor Project (GAP). The map reveals a vast, low-density
    settlement landscape integrated by an elaborate water management network
    covering >1,000 km2, the most extensive urban complex of the preindustrial
    world. It is now clear that anthropogenic changes to the landscape were both
    extensive and substantial enough to have created grave challenges to the
    long-term viability of the settlement.

    For over a century, the landscape of Angkor Wat and its surrounding area
    have been the focus of archaeological study. These studies have been
    constrained substantially, however, by a lack of chronological resolution in
    the features of the landscape and the difficulty of dating elements of the
    cultural assemblage. Recently obtained LiDAR data have transformed
    understanding of the Angkor Wat complex, enabling archaeologists to map
    terrain usually obscured by dense and protected vegetation. The results have
    informed targeted ground-based research, demonstrated previously unknown
    relationships between elements of the site, shown that the complex is much
    more extensive than previously thought and revealed a massive, unique and
    unknown structure.

    Malaysian plural society is characterized by a concentration of Chinese in
    urban and a concentration of Malays in rural areas. So far, economic and
    political factors have been emphasized to explain the spatial
    differentiation of these communities. Though the importance of these factors
    is recognized a cultural dimension is added and its impact analyzed. It is
    argued that Malays and Chinese differ in their cultural values concerning
    space. Whereas the Malay conception of space is centrifocal, the Chinese
    conception of space is bounded. The consistency of this cultural pattern is
    demonstrated by drawing examples from conceptions of geographical, social,
    religious and political space and their combination in an image of the city.
    As Malaysian towns and housing developments are built according to a Chinese
    conception of space, the absorption of Malay rural-urban migrants is impeded
    and Chinese Control over urban commercial activities is maintained. Es ist
    nicht das Bewusstsein der Menschen, das ihr Sein, sondern umgekehrt ihr
    gesellschaftliches Sein, das ihr Bewusstsein bestimmt.

    How the earth’s previous global warming phase, from the tenth to the
    fifteenth centuries, reshaped human societies from the Arctic to the
    Sahara—a wide-ranging history with sobering lessons for our own time. From
    the tenth to the fifteenth centuries the earth experienced a rise in surface
    temperature that changed climate worldwide—a preview of today’s global
    warming. In some areas, including Western Europe, longer summers brought
    bountiful harvests and population growth that led to cultural flowering. In
    the Arctic, Inuit and Norse sailors made cultural connections across
    thousands of miles as they traded precious iron goods. Polynesian sailors,
    riding new wind patterns, were able to settle the remotest islands on earth.
    But in many parts of the world, the warm centuries brought drought and
    famine. Elaborate societies in western and central America collapsed, and
    the vast building complexes of Chaco Canyon and the Mayan Yucatan were left
    empty. As he did in his bestselling The Little Ice Age, anthropologist and
    historian Brian Fagan reveals how subtle changes in the environment had
    far-reaching effects on human life, in a narrative that sweeps from the
    Arctic ice cap to the Sahara to the Indian Ocean. The history of the Great
    Warming of a half millennium ago suggests that we may yet be underestimating
    the power of climate change to disrupt our lives today—and our vulnerability
    to drought, writes Fagan, is the “silent elephant in the room.”

    Deep inlets along the coast, marking the mouths of two southern Tanzanian
    rivers, have formed Kilwa Bay, a basin closed by reefs. Small, meandering
    rivulets of seawater penetrate the local mangrove cover. An island rises
    from the middle of the bay, a protected space that also controlled access to
    the continent. A crop of archaeological sites bear witness to the fact that
    this bay was a privileged zone of human occupation for a millennium. The
    current city of Kilwa is on the continent. The most important ruins are on
    the island: Kilwa Kisiwani, “Kilwa-on-the-island,” in Swahili.  The first

  abstract: >-
    The development of the Swahili world involved new ways of organizing and
    conceiving of space. Archaeology and historical linguistics are both crucial
    in charting the trajectory of changing spatial practice during the late
    first and early second millennium ad, yet their respective datasets have
    been correlated only in specific and restricted ways. In this paper, we take
    the first steps toward working between archaeological and historical
    linguistic data to understand the changing contexts and meanings of Swahili
    spatial practice. We develop this argument in three parts. First, we review
    archaeological approaches to space in the Swahili world and develop a
    holistic view of towns, including both confined and delimited space. Second,
    we offer an archaeologists’ perspective on the development of historical
    linguistics in relation to the Swahili world, exploring the changing
    relationship between linguistics and archaeology and arguing for a greater
    appreciation of context in how archaeological materials are deployed with
    linguistic data. Finally, drawing on new data from Songo Mnara, a
    fourteenth–sixteenth-century Swahili town on the southern Tanzania coast, we
    make a preliminary attempt to reconcile some aspects of the archaeological
    and linguistic datasets. Using published lexical innovations, we suggest
    ways that meaning might be found alternatively in archaeological and
    linguistic data. Our hope is to make some tentative steps toward a mutually
    satisfying way of working between disciplines.

    Geophysical survey at Kilwa Kisiwani, southern Tanzania, has recovered
    evidence for several aspects of town layout and the use of space within the
    town that enhance our understandings of this important Swahili site.
    Although excavations in the 1960s recovered substantial monuments at this
    stonetown and traced a chronology for the development of the site from the
    eighth to the sixteenth centuries AD, the overall site layout has remained
    poorly understood. This paper outlines the possibilities that geophysics
    creates for positioning the excavations within a broader urban landscape,
    and reports on a preliminary season of survey at Kilwa. Two areas were the
    focus offieldwork during 2011. First the main town centre was surveyed, and
    the results suggest a denser town plan of coralbuilt houses that have
    subsequently been robbed. Second, the enigmatic enclosure of Husuni Ndogo
    was explored, and revealed evidence for activity relating to metalworking in
    this monumental space. Un relevé géophysique exécuté à Kilwa Kisiwani, au
    Sud de la Tanzanie, met en évidence certains aspects du plan de la ville et
    de l'utilisation de l'espace à l'intérieur de la ville, ce qui nous permet
    de mieux comprendre cet important site Swahili. Bien que les fouilles
    réalisées pendant les années 60 aient permis de retrouver des monuments
    importants dans cette ville de pierre et de retracer une chronologie du
    développement du site à partir du huitième siècle jusqu'au seizième siècle
    après J-C, l'ensemble du plan du site reste mal compris. Cet article donne
    un aperçu des possibilités offertes par la géophysique pour choisir
    l'emplacement des excavations dans un paysage urbain plus large et rend
    compte d'une saison préliminaire d'études géophysiques à Kilwa. Le travail
    sur le terrain s'est concentré sur deux zones pendant l'année 2011. Le
    centre-ville principal, tout d'abord, a été l'objet d'une étude
    topographique et les résultats suggèrent un plan de ville plus dense,
    composé de maisons construites en corail qui ont été ultérieurement
    cambriolées. Puis, l'enceinte énigmatique de Husuni Ndogo a été explorée,
    l'espace monumental témoignant d'une activité métallurgique.

    Public spaces have been long recognized as integral parts of urban settings,
    often granted importance by the public ceremonies and spectacles that they
    hosted. Interpretations of such public arenas often focus on elites that use
    them to construct and legitimize power and authority; city residents are
    thought to either accept these political machinations, or reject them and
    the space itself. Alternately, studies of public space that emphasize more
    practical uses, such as for production or other domestic activities tend to
    focus on those spaces directly associated with houses, emphasizing the
    everyday life of city residents. This paper works to set aside this
    dichotomy by exploring the multi-faceted open spaces at Songo Mnara, a
    medieval Swahili town on the southern Tanzanian coast. Songo Mnara is
    particularly well-suited to a study of Swahili public space because of its
    short occupation and clear town plan understood through standing
    architecture; it is likely the best example of how the southern Swahili
    understood a planned town should be organized in the fifteenth century AD.
    Archaeological research directed at the site’s open spaces has revealed a
    variety of public spaces which include a mix of deliberately-maintained
    areas reflecting some element of control and planning, and other less formal
    public spaces that seem to have been organized and maintained by non-elite
    residents of the town. This essay reviews literature on the archaeology of
    open and public space and explores how the case of Songo Mnara contributes
    to it, by walking the reader through what has been learned about the complex
    and variable public spaces of the town. The public spaces of Songo Mnara
    serve to broaden previous dichotomous approaches to urban open space.

                The temple of Angkor Wat, visited annually by tens of thousands of tourists, is without question one of the great archaeological sites of mainland Southeast Asia. Less obvious to the casual visitor is that it was but a single element in a large dispersed city. The papers in this special section demonstrate how recent research using LiDAR, ground-penetrating radar and targeted excavation have transformed our understanding of Angkor Wat and its surroundings.

    The current situation of vernacular architecture is a result of the
    different perspectives of agents who have some sort of direct or indirect
    relationship with the architecture of the past which has influenced
    attitudes and ways of thinking, thus guaranteeing its assessment and
    survival. Therefore, this article reviews recent currents of thought and
    theories encapsulating the increased value of vernacular architecture. In
    the eighteenth century, this architecture made the romantic ideals of rural
    society synonymous with its surroundings, territory and country. In the
    twentieth century, a select few modernist intellectuals carried out in-depth
    studies of this architectural type in relation to its formal values. Now, in
    the twenty-first century, it has become the object of technological and
    scientific analysis for many experts. The current situation still presents
    many unresolved problems, which are perhaps the result of little thought
    having been put into specific aspects of the process of vernacular
    architecture.

    Today, the contemporary residential design has been promoted in cities
    without concerns of the essence of vernacular houses. Recent studies declare
    that the quality of contemporary residential spaces is often poorly linked
    to traditions and value of each region. In view of the rapid modernization
    of Malaysia, the kampong houses as Malay vernacular built environments have
    been replaced by modern residential design. Thus, several aspects of kampong
    which embody major vernacular values are lost. Accordingly, many Malay
    inhabitants still prefer to live in houses that are based on their own
    traditions. This is because quality of housing as one of the fundamental
    factors in enhancing the quality of life is not fully in line with their
    daily lifestyle and local environmental characteristics. Hence, the
    congruency among local daily functions, environmental characteristics of
    region, and vernacular functional spatial features is perceived as a
    substantial principle for enhancing the quality of life. The study theorizes
    that the aforementioned congruity must be considered during the contemporary
    residential design in order to address the actual needs of users for
    enhancing their quality of life. In this line, theoretical analysis
    concludes that among all identified values, privacy and optimal use of space
    are the significant social values while natural ventilation is the most
    significant environmental value extracted from the analysis of Malay houses.

  title: What can we learn from Malay vernacular houses?

  abstract: >-
    Malaysia is a tropical country and has rich tradition of vernacular
    architecture. Traditional vernacular houses (Kampung Houses) are proved to
    be environmentally sustainable, and the neighborhoods containing these
    houses traditionally showed the potential to build up community bonding
    inside the neighborhood, and hence social sustainable. But the future of
    this social sustainability might be in danger. Malaysia is currently rapidly
    urbanizing, and now 72 percent people live in urban areas. These urban areas
    are often very close to the Kampungs, and local people often move to urban
    houses. The urban housings lack the traditional pattern of community
    bonding. With every respect to the environmental sustainability of Kampung
    houses, and recognizing the rich tradition of social sustainability of
    Kampung neighborhoods as a whole, the question is whether Kampung
    communities will remain socially sustainable in future. This study took an
    ethnographic method, and interviewed existing Kampung dwellers of three
    different generations for their view on why people should or should not live
    in Kampungs in future. After qualitative analysis, several interesting
    findings evolved through grounded theories, and the study tried to suggest
    strategies on how to bridge this increasing gap between living harmoniously
    both in the rural and urban setup for the future generations in Malaysia.
    Data showed that though all generations acknowledged the benefits of living
    in Kampungs, better job opportunity motivates the young generation to leave
    Kampungs. It concludes that Kampungs still have the power to sustain the
    modern society with its powerful social potentials, but needs to be nurtured
    with modern facilities.

  abstract: >-
    A large number of random studies on traditional Islamic cities have been
    published over the past two decades. This paper suggests 15 studies which
    need to be thoroughly researched and published to add to our current
    knowledge base on this subject. Once this material is available, it would be
    feasible to construct a comprehensive theory of urban form in traditional
    Islamic cities, which currently does not exist.

  abstract: >-
    In the early years of the 19th century, Uthman dan Fodio and his supporters,
    including his brother Abdallah and son Mohammad Bello, unified vast
    territories, including what is now northern Nigeria, into an Islamic state
    known as the Sokoto Caliphate. During this period, a great deal of
    scholarship on Islamic law was revived and written by Uthman, his brother
    and son, and other local scholars. Imbedded in this literature is material
    relating to policies and rules that were followed in decision making and
    affected various levels of the built environment. These include policies for
    the establishment of new settlements and numerous rules relating to the
    processes of change and growth within the fabric of new settlements and
    established cities. This study documents the results of the analysis of this
    scholarship, and it is illustrated by examples from the traditional city of
    Zaria.

    The Tamil country of South India experienced a flowering of political,
    economic, and cultural forces during the Chola period (849–1279). The
    environments supporting this expansion were nucleated settlements focused on
    temples, surrounded by verdant paddy fields with artificial irrigation
    networks. This article is a study of the sacred sites and nucleated
    settlements that were the heart of this medieval civilization. The purposes
    of the study are two: first, to portray the dynamics of early urbanism
    during a crucial period of regional integration in South Asia, and
    especially to portray the geography of early centers; second, to provide the
    basis for a comparative study of early South Indian urbanism and premodern
    urbanism in other world areas.

    Studies relating to the architectural transformation of Javanese Palace
    ranging from the late Hindu-Buddhist era of the Majapahit Kingdom to the
    subsequent Islamic era have not yielded any substantial revelations so far.
    This phenomenon can be said to suffer from a missing link. Dalem Agung
    Pakungwati is estimated to be one of the first palaces to have been
    established in the era of Early Islamic development on Java after the fall
    of the Majapahit Kingdom and is currently part of the Kasepuhan Palace in
    Cirebon, West Java. This study is expected to be an eye-opener leading to
    new insights, which can be used to examine the spatial pattern of the
    transitional palatial architecture from the Hindu- 

    Buddhist Era to the Islamic Era. This research has been conducted with both
    the historical and qualitative approach. 

    Through this study, the Dalem Agung Pakungwati Palace can be identified as
    showing a spatial pattern that contained the transformative Hindu-Majapahit
    concept of Islamic values. The findings obtained are expected to be used to
    reconstruct the local values in the form of understanding the spatial
    pattern of architecture as the genuine essence or identity of the
    archipelagic architecture that is sensitive to the appreciation of ancestral
    heritage.

    Traditions of regular town planning began to develop in Burma during the
    Christian era. In the feudal period, especially in the 14th to 19th
    centuries, the art of town planning flourished here, where it was promoted
    more than in any other country of the region. Unfortunately, this rich
    legacy has not been studied in any detail. Even plans of most Burmese
    historical cities have not been professionally drawn and published. In this
    article, some of the finest examples of Burmese feudal cities-Ava, Toungoo,
    Pegu, Amarapura, and Mandalay-are described and analyzed for the first time.
    Several conclusions are drawn from this material: that the square form of
    city plans was developed independently in Burma, that the traditional cities
    were regularly planned and well coordinated with the local topography, and
    that the most effective and progressive building technology was used in city
    construction.

    Much archaeological and historical research has recently been devoted to the
    study of the early Swahili communities inhabiting the East African coast
    during the late first millennium a.d. The practice of Islam can be shown to
    date back to perhaps the beginning of the ninth century from when the first
    mosques have been excavated. The economic importance of East Africa for the
    Indian Ocean and Mediterranean world is apparent from the wealth of imports
    and exports found in a large number of these coastal sites. African trading
    systems brought to medieval society high-value commodities ranging from
    gold, rock crystal and ivory, to slaves and timber. The items were carried
    across large distances sea by traders following the seasonal monsoon system
    around the coasts and across the Indian Ocean. is argued that the trading
    settlements were African in culture and origin, but then attracted Muslims
    who were responsible for occasional local converts from a very early period
    in the history of Islam.

    Criticisms of the Central Cattle Pattern raise a number of issues in African
    archaeology; for example the use of ethnographic analogy, identity versus
    worldview, the nature and extent of cultural change over time, and
    hypothesis comparison. While necessary, the criticisms are without

    substance. At a general level the Central Cattle Pattern provides insights
    into the antiquity of bridewealth in cattle and the origins of the Zimbabwe
    culture. As a high-level normative model, however, it is not equipped to
    explain variation in detail.

    Stratified societies in southern Africa first developed in the
    Shashe–Limpopo Basin. As is well known, rank-based society at K2 developed
    into class distinction at Mapungubwe. The transfer of this new social
    organisation to Great Zimbabwe has received less attention. New research on
    rainmaking practices suggests that a Mapungubwe dynasty introduced class
    structures at Great Zimbabwe. Poor climatic conditions at the end of the
    13th century undermined sacred leaders at Mapungubwe itself, and while
    vulnerable, the elite at Great Zimbabwe took over the important gold and
    ivory trade. Among other things, the new elite used the unique Zimbabwe
    birdstones to establish their legitimacy.

    The Malay traditional environment is the interaction between human, natural
    environment, and culture, which is then translated into the spatial design
    of houses and their surroundings. However, rapid urbanisation has
    transformed many traditional villages by incorporating urban elements into
    the villages. This study focuses on understanding the existence of the
    socio-cultural values of a traditional Malay house compound in Kampung Paya
    Rumput Jaya, Melaka. The objective of this study is to identify the Malay
    socio-cultural values and the spatial arrangement of the traditional Malay
    house compound. Data were collected by means of a questionnaire survey,
    semi-structured interviews, a mapping analysis (site inventory), and a
    thematic/content analysis (interviews). The findings indicate that the
    community in the villages are still upholding the Malay traditional
    socio-cultural values. Future design of a house compound should incorporate
    the characterisation of a traditional Malay houses compound for maintaining
    at least part of the Malay traditional socio-cultural values.

    From First Nations gunyahs and First Fleet huts to 21st century
    eco-pavilions and skyscrapers, Davina Jackson surveys the evolution of
    architecture in Australia. Dr Jackson explores how early colonial building
    designers like James Bloodworth, Francis Greenway and John Lee Archer
    interpreted classical European styles using local stone and timber. She
    examines how medieval and Renaissance monuments influenced leading
    architects during the 19th century, until the fresh winds of modernism and
    demands for a unique Australian style took over in the 20th century, with
    environmental challenges and technological innovations driving change in
    recent years. Over two and a half centuries, our architects and builders
    have responded to the fierce Australian sun with verandas, porticos,
    colonnades, screens and Asian-inspired shade pavilions. Jackson explores
    these and other distinctive aspects of Australian design, why gold-boom
    architecture consistently impressed Victorian visitors, and the achievements
    of modern luminaries like Walter and Marion Griffin, Harry Seidler, Jorn
    Utzon, John Andrews, Glenn Murcutt and John Wardle. Illustrated throughout,
    Australian Architecture traces our distinctive and internationally acclaimed
    domestic, commercial and institutional buildings, with overviews of the main
    design influences and key examples to visit. This is the essential guide for
    designers, architects, students and anyone interested in the story of
    Australia's unique and fascinating architecture.

    Because extensive European acquaintance with the African interior dates only
    to the nineteenth century, it is often assumed that this is territory
    without a history. Indeed, earlier written documents are far rarer here than
    in many other parts of the world. Nonetheless, we know that even when
    Portuguese sailors first arrived on the African coasts in the fifteenth
    century, the borders of the territories occupied by various peoples were
    fluid and often disputed. Only when Africa was colonized by Europeans, a
    process that began in the fifteenth century and culminated in the Italian
    conquest of Ethiopia in the 1930s, were

    " The first global history of architecture to give equal attention to
    Western and non-Western structures and built landscapes, Architecture since
    1400 is unprecedented in its range, approach, and insight. From
    Tenochtitlan's Great Pyramid in Mexico City and the Duomo in Florence to
    Levittown's suburban tract housing and the Bird's Nest Stadium in Beijing,
    its coverage includes the world's most celebrated structures and spaces
    along with many examples of more humble vernacular buildings. Lavishly
    illustrated with more than 300 photographs, plans, and interiors, this book
    presents key moments and innovations in architectural modernity around the
    globe. Deftly integrating architectural and social history, Kathleen
    James-Chakraborty pays particular attention to the motivations of client and
    architect in the design and construction of environments both sacred and
    secular: palaces and places of worship as well as such characteristically
    modern structures as the skyscraper, the department store, and the cinema.
    She also focuses on the role of patrons and addresses to an unparalleled
    degree the impact of women in commissioning, creating, and inhabiting the
    built environment, with Gertrude Jekyll, Lina Bo Bardi, and Zaha Hadid
    taking their place beside Brunelleschi, Sinan, and Le Corbusier. Making
    clear that visionary architecture has never been the exclusive domain of the
    West and recognizing the diversity of those responsible for commissioning,
    designing, and constructing buildings, Architecture since 1400 provides a
    sweeping, cross-cultural history of the built environment over six
    centuries. "--

    In the minds of most present day Australians, both indigenous and
    non-indigenous, “engineering” came to the continent with the first
    Europeans. However, if one looks at what “engineering” really is, then
    structures from history and pre-history, especially in the Middle East,
    which supplied water to growing settlements cannot be ignored; there were
    excellent examples present in Australia which may even pre-date those in
    many northern hemisphere civilisations. This paper looks particularly at the
    aquaculture structures built from the Budj Bim lava flows (Mt Eccles) in
    southwestern Victoria. The aquaculture industry produced a permanent food
    supply, a permanent settlement, food trading and a different form of
    governance than was generally found elsewhere in Australia. The works have
    now been recognised as an Engineering Heritage National Landmark by the
    Institution of Engineers Australia (commonly referred to as “Engineers
    Australia).

    Vernacular architecture is manifested by a large variety of forms that have
    a diversity of explanations. This arises from the idea that people of
    different backgrounds and cultures respond differently to wideranging
    physical environments and the interplay of socio-cultural factors. In this
    paper, the authors introduce the development of Swahili architecture in
    Kenya as a response to warm-humid climate. Initially, to encapsulate generic
    design recommendations for this climate, bio-climatic design responses were
    derived using Mahoney Tables analysis and reinforced by guidelines obtained
    from previous research. This revealed conspicuously supportive arguments for
    lightweight air-permeable buildings in contrast to the existing Swahili form
    that is noticeably heavyweight. An exploration of the influence of
    socio-cultural factors and building materials enabled the authors to explain
    how these and other factors may have masked or overridden the sole effect of
    climatic parameters resulting in the heavyweight typology. Further, field
    study investigations of a series of Swahili buildings in Mombasa were
    conducted during the warmest periods of two years. In this paper the authors
    focused on the findings from the investigations of one of those buildings.
    Results showed indoor temperatures lower than corresponding outdoor
    temperatures by up to 7°C during peak times. Additionally, an occupancy
    survey conducted during the study periods found that up to 70% (during the
    warmest months) and 99% (during the coolest months) of the occupants found
    the studied building thermally comfortable. These analyses of the
    environmental response of this architectural typology revealed the
    suitability of plan, form and fabric characteristics. It was concluded that
    vernacular Swahili housing could offer insights into a different and valid
    approach for design of passive contemporary buildings within the local
    warm-humid climate. K eywords: Swahili architecture, heavyweight

    center of the Kilwa Sultanate, a medieval sultanate whose authority at its
    height in the 13th-15th centuries stretched the entire length of the Swahili
    Coast. Kilwa Kisiwani has been designated by UNESCO as a World Heritage Site

    The Kilwa Sultanate was a Medieval sultanate, centered at Kilwa (an island
    off modern-day Tanzania), whose authority, at its height, stretched over the
    entire length of the Swahili Coast. According to the legend, it was founded
    in the 10th century by Ali ibn al-Hassan Shirazi, a Persian prince of
    Shiraz. His family ruled the Sultanate until the year 1277. They were
    replaced by the Arab family of Abu Moaheb until 1505, when they were
    overthrown by a Portuguese invasion. By 1513, the sultanate was already
    fragmented into smaller states, many of which became protectorates of the
    Sultanate of Oman.

    Angkor is one of the world’s largest premodern settlement complexes (9th to
    15th centuries CE), but to date, no comprehensive demographic study has been
    completed, and key aspects of its population and demographic history remain
    unknown. Here, we combine lidar, archaeological excavation data, radiocarbon
    dates, and machine learning algorithms to create maps that model the
    development of the city and its population growth through time. We conclude
    that the Greater Angkor Region was home to approximately 700,000 to 900,000
    inhabitants at its apogee in the 13th century CE. This granular, diachronic,
    paleodemographic model of the Angkor complex can be applied to any ancient
    civilization.

    Geospatial technologies such as GIS, remote sensing, and GNSS are
    transforming landscape archaeology, particularly in research areas that are
    hard to access due to geographical size, environmental challenges, lack of
    infrastructure, and/or political instability. In the following article, we
    explore the potential of high-resolution, multispectral satellite imagery
    for building a predictive model of the settlement pattern of the Iron Age
    polity of Bosutswe (700–1650 CE) in Botswana. While the case study lies in
    Africa, the problems that Africanists experience extend far beyond the
    continent. With limited funding, poor access to survey regions, and
    countless others, predictive modelling has the potential to identify more
    robust archaeological landscapes. Using ArcGIS 10.6, ENVI 5.4, and WorldView
    2 and 3 imagery, we catalog 22 prospective archaeological sites within a 5
    km radius of Bosutswe (100 sq. km), demonstrating the potential for image
    classification to identify sites difficult to locate in a traditional
    pedestrian survey. The discovery of these new, often small sites has
    implications for past environmental utilization and for regional
    sociopolitical dynamics. We describe our test excavation at one new site,
    Letlalolanoga, to demonstrate how it may contribute towards a growing body
    of literature that favors heterarchical power relations within African
    complex societies.

    This article presents a critical review of diverse yet recurrent
    interpretations of vernacular architecture, which have been published in
    either English or French during the last one hundred years. These
    interpretations have been classified as the aesthetic/formalist
    interpretation, the typological approach, evolutionary theory, diffusionism
    of a social and geographical kind, physical explanations, social
    explanations and socia-cultural factors. This article reveals two dominant
    approaches: those that imply that vernacular buildings need not or cannot be
    studied historically, and those that explore the evolution of building types
    in very limited geographical contexts. In conclusion, a redefinition of a
    method for the study of vernacular architecture is requested and suggested
    by reference to a study which has employed this approach.

  abstract: |-
    For the past 15 years Kampong Ayer, Brunei's 
    famous water villages and former empire's 
    capital has been left to decay slowly. Debates 
    about its future are held far from its 
    inhabitants and away from Brunei's 
    population that all have their roots in it. This 
    paper attempts to show that this static phase 
    of the village history, with centralized external 
    forces holding its development and planning 
    its redevelopment, has not occurred during 
    1300 years of history. This does not follow the 
    traditional pattern of urban development of 
    the Vernacular Southeast Asian Coastal Cities 
    [VSEACC], thus any decision made with this 
    new process will dramatically change the face 
    of Kampong Ayer. 
    I argue that Kampong Ayer is an example of a 
    unique type of city that existed during the 
    historical period from the 7th century to the 
    end of the 20th century. The raison d'etre of 
    these cities were to be polities and trading 
    centres, connected with outside world, points 
    of exchange between people, goods, ideas, 
    between seas, rivers and land. 
    There is no research in the urban discipline 
    about the structure of the VSEACC, I propose 
    to use the anthropological model of urban 
    definition developed by 0'Connor(1983) as 
    framework of analysis of its structure and 
    evolution. As he postulates, in Southeast Asia, 
    urban fabrication is a corollary of social 
    structures. To describe the urban form it is 
    then necessary to understand these 
    structures and spatialise them. This will set 
    the background for a brief sketch of the 
    history of Brunei Kampong Ayer.

    In the past few decades, community resilience has become a critical topic
    gaining increasing academic and programmatic attention (Skerratt, 2013;
    Skerratt and Steiner, 2013; Steiner and Markantoni, 2014). The departure
    from the ‘predict and prevent’ model (IFRC, 2012) in development discourse
    has led to attention given to uncertain disruptions that may impact
    communities. Concurrently, human settlements around the world are evolving
    in response to changing development trajectories. Settlements have become
    more complex communities of connectivity and interdependency. However, the
    complexity is explained by the vulnerability to disruptions that can turn
    highly functional settlements into dysfunction. In Zimbabwe, human
    settlements have

    Grounded in rich interview material recorded in Leiden, this article
    documents the artistry, passion, and professional dedication of a group of
    Malian craftsmen. In their own words (translated and transcribed from
    Bamanakan into English), five mud masons of Djenné deliberate upon training
    regimes, the growing importance of literacy and numeracy in their practice,
    competition and intergenerational conflict, the role of secrets in building
    construction, and new trajectories and contemporary challenges in the trade.
    In reflecting upon the current crises, their discussion also contributes to
    an understanding of ordinary people's struggles, ambitions, and changing
    life strategies during this difficult period in the nation's history. Nin

    Several researchers believe that Pura- a Hindu temple- in Bali is not just
    merely a place of worship. In Sanskrit that word means a fortress, while
    several early investigations show that the pura is sharing several same
    characteristics with the fortress by design. High fences, small entrance,
    limited access and also the existence of observation tower was among the
    characteristics. The aim of this study is to proof that the pura
    architecture was not something brought from Majapahit, but on the contrary
    is an architecture built in the land of Bali by the Majapahit priest
    Danghyang Nirartha, after the fall of Majapahit to be a fortress, to avoid
    any acts and values came from outside to infiltrate the Hindu culture in
    Bali. The Architectural survey method was chosen to bring about any
    knowledge regarding this issue, while as samples 3 pura around Denpasar was
    chosen to represent the pura of southern part of Bali where the architecture
    was developed in the past. The result of this paper is a description of how
    the now place of worship can be developed from some thought as a result of
    political event in the past and as the conclusion, through the years it
    became a common pattern within the people of Bali.

    Colonial ethnographers commenced compiling records on Australian indigenous
    shelters and camps from the 1870s and this work was extended into more
    complex settlement models by a small number of anthropologists and
    archaeologists in the mid-twentieth century. Building on this earlier work,
    a distinctive architectural anthropology has been developed and practised by
    researchers at the Aboriginal Environments Research Centre (AERC) based at
    the School of Architecture, University of Queensland, since the 1970s. The
    broad focus is on the nature of people–environment relationships of
    Australian Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples, but the resulting
    theories and methods may contribute to ongoing developments in the field
    internationally. This paper (with the aid of a case study) demonstrates how
    various research tools in the AERC theoretical frame have been incorporated
    into design processes, including the constructs of the “intercultural”,
    “recognition space”, “personhood”, and “cultural landscape”.

    A systematic assessment of urban morphological analysis is crucial to
    understand the patterns in which cities are built and transformed henceforth
    revealed its character. However, there is a significant lag in integrating
    the analytical process of urban morphological approaches to explain the
    spatial formation and transformation process of Malay towns which remains
    unclear Aims to excerpt the morphogenetic processes that had shaped and
    influenced the spatial structure of Malay town, a case study in Kota Bharu,
    Kelantan were employed to present the historical evolution of the town and
    recognise the socio-physical influences contributed to the structural
    changes based on data gathered from archival research and site observation.
    From a diachronic comparison, the mapping analysis process outlined three
    morphological phases between the years of 1816 until 1909 at five defined
    urban morphological zones (UMZ). The findings revealed significant changes
    had occurred at the level of urban block which created a more complex
    spatial structure in its composition and layout. This study enhanced the
    understanding of the organic forms of spatial evolution in Malay town for
    delineation of area-based in urban conservation planning.

    Large migration from rural areas to urban areas like Kuala Lumpur has led to
    some implications for economic, social and cultural development. This high
    population has placed enormous demand on the existing housing stocks,
    especially for low-income groups. However, some issues arise, one of which
    is overheated indoor air temperature. This problem contributes to the
    high-energy usage that forces huge sums of money to be spent on cooling the
    house by using mechanical equipment. Therefore, this study focuses on
    thermal comfort in social housing, and incorporates traditional values into
    its design to achieve a certain measurement of natural ventilation in a
    house. From the study, the carbon emission and energy consumption for an
    air-conditioned house is 67%, 66% higher than a naturally ventilated house.
    Therefore, this research has come up with a new typology design, which has a
    large exposed wall area and full-length openings on the opposite walls to
    increase cross ventilation. At the end of this research, the measurement of
    thermal comfort for a naturally ventilated building called 'Air House' has
    been identified.

    Swahili architecture is characterised by grandeur stone houses on one side
    and earth-and-wattle houses on the other. By considering the concept of
    transculturation as introduced by Felipe Hernandez et al. (2005), and
    employing hermeneutic research methods in the critical analysis of
    historical data, this paper explores the factors that contributed to the
    transformation of Swahili material culture and the perceived dual nature of
    the urban morphology. Key findings point towards a broader range of
    socio-cultural issues namely; trade, market competition among merchants,
    increased population densities, practices of sponsorship, involvement, and
    the adoption of immigrants as the motivations for the transformation from
    earth-and-wattle to stone building technology. The author recommends an
    analysis of Swahili architecture that extends beyond the widely-accepted
    traditional symbols in order to uncover the underlying intangible heritage.

    This chapter discusses the urban challenges experienced by Lamu Old Town, a
    World Heritage site in Kenya. The paper reviews the interventions being
    undertaken jointly by Government of Kenya, the National Museums of Kenya,
    the County Government of Lamu and its predecessor the County Council of Lamu
    in trying to safeguard the Outstanding Universal Value while also enhancing
    the attributes and functionality of the historic old town as it struggles to
    meet the challenges associated with urban growth and development. The
    chapter highlights the potential of Historic Urban Landscape tools in
    enhancing the future development of the town.Lamu Old Town is regarded as
    the oldest and best preserved of the Swahili settlements in East Africa, and
    it still retains its traditional character and functions. The town received
    national recognition in 1986 and was subsequently inscribed on the UNESCO
    World Heritage list in 2001. Over the last 10 years, Lamu Town has
    experienced an inordinate population increase resulting from an influx of
    immigrant job seekers. The ensuing high demand for housing has resulted in
    the development of informal settlements around the old town, which now
    impacts negatively on the character and attributes of the town. Mega
    infrastructural developments earmarked for development within the precincts
    of the adjacent mainland coastline also pose a threat to the integrity of
    the old town.Previous partnerships on the implementation of the UNESCO
    supported programmes on Historic Urban Landscapes have enabled site managers
    to argue for the integration of conservation initiatives into the broader
    development agenda of the county government. In order to enhance the quality
    of life within the town for both visitors and residents, the County
    Government of Lamu (CGL) has initiated a number of ongoing infrastructural
    improvement projects. The projects include paving of open public spaces,
    pedestrian walkways and provision of street lights.

    British colonial authorities adhered to a philosophy of racial segregation
    while their French counterparts subscribed to one that segregates along
    socioeconomic and cultural lines. This article interrogates the rationale
    for these two colonial philosophies and addresses the following questions:
    How were these philosophies given physical expression in colonial urban
    space? Why did the two seemingly opposing philosophies produce identical
    racially segregated urban space? It is argued that although the two colonial
    powers had different racial philosophies, they shared common cultural,
    psychological, political, social, and ideological objectives that were best
    accomplished through racially segregated space.

    This is a book about cities or, more precisely, about the physical form of
    cities. It starts presenting the main elements of urban form – streets,
    urban blocks, plots and buildings – structuring our cities and the
    fundamental actors and processes of transformation shaping these elements.
    It then applies this analytical framework to describe the evolution of
    cities over history as well as to explain the functioning of contemporary
    cities. After the initial focus on the ‘object’ (cities) the book describes
    how different researchers and different schools of thought have been dealing
    with this object since the emergence of Urban Morphology, as the science of
    urban form, in the turning to the twentieth century. Finally, the book tries
    to identify what are the most important (and specific) contributions that
    Urban Morphology has to offer to contemporary cities, societies and
    economies.

    This volume focuses on the implementation of the 2011 UNESCO Recommendation
    on the Historic Urban Landscape (HUL approach), designed to foster the
    integration of heritage management in regional and urban planning and
    management, and strengthen the role of heritage in sustainable urban
    development. Earlier publications and research looked at the underlying
    theory of why the HUL approach was needed and how this theory was developed
    and elaborated by UNESCO. A comprehensive analysis was carried out in
    consultation with a multitude of actors in the twenty-first-century urban
    scene and with disciplinary approaches that are available to heritage
    managers and practitioners to implement the HUL approach. This volume aims
    to be empirical, describing, analyzing, and comparing 28 cities taken as
    case studies to implement the HUL approach. From those cases, many lessons
    can be learned and much guidance shared on best practices concerning what
    can be done to make the HUL approach work. Whereas the previous studies
    served to illustrate issues and challenges, in this volume the studies point
    to innovations in regional and urban planning and management that can allow
    cities to avoid major conflicts and to further develop in competitiveness.
    These accomplishments have been possible by building partnerships, devising
    financial strategies, and using heritage as a key resource in sustainable
    urban development, to name but a few effective strategies. For these
    reasons, this volume is primarily pragmatic, linked to the daily work and
    challenges of practitioners and administrators, using specific cases to
    assess what was and is good about current practices and what can be
    improved, in accordance with the HUL approach and aims.

    The ongoing debate among practitioners and in academia about the meaning and
    understanding of Islamic architecture will be energized by this book. It
    contains essays by architects and academics from various parts of the world
    which clarify how the carious disciplines of the design profession can be
    employed to build in the spirit of Islam. Divided into three sections the
    book covers: *meaning from Faith, which draws meaning from the Islamic faith
    in order to propose a built environment that is universally
    beneficial*analysis of History, which examines historical buildings and
    planning concepts, and suggest how to apply lessons learned to contemporary
    practice*contemporary Trends, which discusses current trends in
    architecture, education and socio-economic aspects of various Muslim
    countries. Illustrated throughout, this book will appeal to students and
    scholars, practising architects and planners alike.

    In recent years, the debate on urban morphology has been polarized by two
    different perspectives, the first developed within the International Seminar
    on Urban Form (ISUF), based on the Conzenian and the Muratorian traditions,
    and the second – space syntax – developed particularly in University College
    London. Both approaches are being further developed in a wide international
    context. The first and the second parts of this paper describe the origins,
    main characteristics, and contributions of these approaches, which are
    illustrated by the authors on‐going research on Oporto urban form in
    Portugal. The last part presents some suggestions for bridging the gap
    between these approaches.

    Purpose
                  While a substantial amount of study of informal settlements has been undertaken, they remain largely unstudied in terms of urban form. In this analysis, the purpose of this paper is to set forth a conceptual framework, which considers the context in which informality takes place, the settlement itself, the houses contained therein, the dwellers of those houses and the process through which a settlement is designed and transformed over time.
                
                
                  Design/methodology/approach
                  This is a literature review.
                
                
                  Findings
                  This framework aims to be sufficiently flexible to be deployed across diverse national settings. Its formulation is important because informal settlements are a permanent fixture of the global urban landscape, and are increasing in scale.
                
                
                  Originality/value
                  Any sustainable strategies to improve informal settlements depend on a better understanding of their urban space, as well as of the producers of this space – the residents themselves. Finally, professional designers may be able to learn from this contemporary urban vernacular grammar – perhaps the only one left in the era of sanitized, contrived and prosaic urban design.

    Encore doctorant en 1998, j’ai eu le plaisir de travailler avec Monik
    Kervran sur son chantier à Sewan Shariff au Pakistan. Monik a fait partie de
    mon jury de thèse en 2001 pour sa grande connaissance du commerce dans
    l’océan Indien. Elle a notamment publié un article sur une mosquée bahrainie
    où elle trace des parallèles intéressants avec la mosquée swahilie de
    Kizimkazi à Zanzibar (Kervran et Kalus 1990:48-49). Depuis, les fouilles
    archéologiques que je mène en Afrique orientale ont permis d’ajouter de
    nouveaux éléments à notre connaissance du commerce entre l’Afrique orientale
    et les pays musulmans. Les informations présentées

    Degree: M.Phil.DegreeYear: 2000Institute: University of Hong Kong (People''s
    Republic of China)This study will challenge the long accepted traditional
    idea of Chinese architecture and scope of Chinese architectural research.
    Does Chinese architecture only involve that which is inside China, and is
    Chinese architectural history research confined to the territory within
    China?Temples and huiguans created by Chinese immigrants in the Malacca
    Straits provide the focus for the research. Specifically, this study aims to
    reestablish the architectural connection between China''s southern Fujian
    province and the Malacca Straits. Through studying Chinese temples and
    huiguans, the research''s scope about Chinese architecture has been extended
    in order to present a multi-level expression of Chinese architecture based
    on Chinese cultural entity. Key questions clarified in this study are
    whether these temples and huiguans are just the transplantation of their
    prototypes in southern China, or whether they are changed in the new
    settlement, and what made these changes. Why can they still be called
    Chinese architecture?

    By juxtaposing case studies from various colonial and postcolonial settings
    from around the world, this edited volume provides a comprehensive and
    diachronic investigation of the ways in which architecture and urban space
    mediate the intersections of colonialism, nationalism, and modernity.
    Besides offering unique historical perspectives on colonialism, nationalism
    and modernity, each case-study also reassesses theories regarding memory and
    monumentalization; the appropriation and deployment of tradition in the
    service of nationalism; and the institutions of modernity.

    This chapter clarifies my position vis-à-vis both the “New Archaeology” and
    current approaches. It briefly describes environment–behavior studies (EBS)
    and discusses the mutual relevance of the two fields, emphasizing the role
    EBS can play in archaeological inference. Examples, mainly from the
    post-1990s archaeological literature, are used to support the argument.

    This paper reports a study of the historical and functional morphology of
    the Stone Town of Zanzibar in Tanzania. The town is interesting because its
    mostly fine-grained physical fabric with an irregular street grid shows a
    remarkable degree of consistency despite the fact that it evolved under
    significantly different social, economic and political conditions.
    Therefore, the study of historical morphology was aimed at identifying if
    the town went through any structural changes despite its physical
    continuity; and the study of functional morphology was aimed at identifying
    the relationship between functions and the structure of the town. For
    historical morphology, three street maps representing three distinct
    historical phases of the town were studied using the techniques of the axial
    map analysis of Space Syntax. For functional morphology, the relationships
    between the axial structure of the present-day street grid and land use
    patterns, ownership patterns, building classifications based on ethnic
    influences, significant buildings and streetscape elements, and building
    conditions were studied explaining the spatial distribution of functions in
    the town. The study found that the axial structure of this town had a
    diffused pattern of syntactic centrality that took different shapes in
    different phases of its development. The study also found that the axial
    structure of the town has been a strong force determining the present-day
    spatial distribution of functions in the town. Based on the findings, the
    paper then describes a dialectical relationship between history and function
    in the Stone Town. By combining historical and functional morphology, this
    study provides a methodology for an enriched understanding of the
    morphological processes of growth and transformation of a city, in which the
    historical and functional specificity of the city is complemented by a more
    generic description of the street network offered by Space Syntax. As a
    result, the study contributes to standard Space Syntax analysis that usually
    takes a synchronic view of cities and spatial structures for the sake of a
    more generic theory of urban form; and to historical research that usually
    consults any number of historical sources for the sake of a rich description
    specific to an historical reality, but does not analyse the spatial
    morphology of cities in a comparative or systematic way. With the enriched
    morphological perspective of this study, it may now be possible to describe
    precisely the socio-spatial and spatio-temporal processes, emphasising the
    relationship between design and the politics of power of other traditional
    cities that went through similar historical experiences as the Stone Town of
    Zanzibar.

    This article examines the historical architecture and elite palace sites of
    the nineteenth-century Sultanate of Zanzibar. Archaeological coastal survey
    and historical research is used to discuss the way in which these built
    structures demonstrate the changing forces of mercantile control in the
    Western Indian Ocean. On moving his court to Zanzibar from Oman in 1828,
    Seyyid Said bin Sultan set about consolidating his authority. This
    consolidation and subsequent demise is reflected, it is argued, in the
    structural remains along Zanzibar’s western coast.

    The concept of tropical architecture is one that was constructed in the
    1950s to link the work of modernist practitioners in a number of locations
    outside the West. Tropical architecture has been represented as a form of
    critical regionalism, in that it offers a language based in the conditions
    of the non-western world. While this may be true of the movement in the
    Americas, in the case of the British colonies of West Africa tropical
    architecture was located within the networks of modernist and colonial
    culture as much as it was place bound. Tropical architecture was established
    in the metropolitan architectural circles of the 1950s through the use of
    the term in books and journals, a conference and a course of specialisation
    in London. These forms of support assisted architects to create modern
    architecture in far-flung sites, under difficult conditions. Despite this
    enmeshment of the peripheral sites of practice with the colonial metropolis
    through communications, tropical architecture was seen as something other
    than colonial architecture. The changing political and economic
    opportunities at the end of the colonial period prompted architects to
    develop a post-colonial identity for architecture, which was done through
    the representation of their approach as one that could transcend national
    boundaries. Tropical Architecture in the Humid Zones , by Fry and Drew
    explicitly offers support for an imaginary architect who comes from a
    generic tropical zone. The influence of the metropolis on the culture of
    tropical architecture remained significant, even after independence. While
    the consistency of approaches that marked the work of the 1950s has been
    replaced by a multiplicity of attitudes to design, the contemporary
    literature, curricula and research on African architecture share an emphasis
    on its climatic conditions. This content, in turn, ties the approach to
    authoritative sources in the West, giving it an identity that links the
    local and the global in complex and interdependent ways.

    A parametric shape grammar of the traditional Malay houses (TMH) built in
    the past century is presented. The grammar, which consists of rules for
    generating the form and structure of TMH, is derived from simple geometric
    representations of the houses. The rules first derive the basic unit
    structures that form the shapes of the TMH. Nine basic shapes have been
    identified that form the main vocabulary elements of the grammar.
    Parameterized polygons and lines define each basic shape. Ranges of values
    assigned to the variables describing the parameterized polygons and lines
    are presented. The shape addition rules are used to characterize the
    compositional aspects of TMH style. Evidences of these basic shapes or their
    combinations have been documented by previous researchers and are used as a

    Heritage cities in the developing nations, including Malaysia, currently
    face intensified urban problems as a result of rapid population growth,
    economic development and population growth. The introduction of new
    townships at the edge of many historic cities in Malaysia has exposed them
    to severe pressure of commercialization, poor design and cultural uniformity
    that has faded away their place identity. Thus, regeneration initiatives
    should be introduced to restore the wealth of the prestigious past of the
    historic cities and to improve the lifestyle of its population, as the
    vibrancy of a heritage site is only significant when its original community
    remains.

    Islam is seen by many scholars as an urban religion, which favours communal
    practice on individual worship. Although, piety is the only source of
    appraisal, it is widely accepted that most of Islam's teaching is best
    practised in an urban setting. It is not surprising that Islam made
    particular emphasis on the form and design of the city enabling it a greater
    functionality and responsiveness to meet the socio-economic and cultural
    needs of the community. This article presents an analysis of the spatial and
    functional arrangements of the Islamic city and assesses their
    socio-cultural meanings.

  abstract: >-
    In this paper I argue that cities in the global South constitute a
    distinctive ‘type’ of human settlement. I begin by critiquing Brenner and
    Schmid’s concept of planetary urbanization which erases difference among
    cities and locates the essence of urbanity in the global North. I echo their
    criticism of postcolonial urbanism, however, which has struggled to
    articulate precisely how Southern cities differ from their Northern
    counterparts. I then propose three tendencies that, when taken together,
    serve as the basis of an emergent paradigm of Southern urbanism. First, I
    assert that cities in the South tend to exhibit a persistent disconnect
    between capital and labor. Second, I demonstrate that their metabolic
    configurations are discontinuous, dynamic and contested. Finally, I argue
    that political economy is not the overriding context within which urban
    processes unfold, but rather it is always already co-constituted with the
    materiality of Southern cities. This is not meant to be a comprehensive list
    of characteristics exhibited uniformly by all cities in the global South.
    Instead, I hope that it serves as a starting point for city-centric
    scholarship that can account for very real differences between/among cities
    without constructing cities in the South as pathological and in need of
    development interventions.

    The increasing intervention from high rise construction and new developments
    within the historic urban fabric is threatening the existing character and
    the Outstanding Universal Value of World Heritage Site List. This paper
    propagates that through the identification of factors that influence the
    character of the historic urban landscape of George Town world heritage
    sites, we are able to understand the relationship between the landscape
    components and its importance to the historic characters of the sites. The
    methodology of this paper is based on written descriptions and site visual
    observation. The outcome of this paper reveals the significance of tangible
    and intangible factors that influence the urban landscape character of the
    site studied.

    The Omani houses of Zanzibar are the tangible legacy of ancient trade links
    and 19th century political domination. These elegant houses are climatically
    effective, and offer private outdoor living space in a dense urban
    environment. This type of house is still popular in Oman, but in Zanzibar it
    is threatened. As background this report reviews the state of the literature
    related to the Omani houses of Zanzibar and also presents a very brief
    historical perspective. A description of the selected case study in its
    current state is followed by a proposed reconstruction to its perceived
    original form when built in the 19th century. This exercise reveals a
    concept of great sophistication and clarity. Although the planning process
    and the 

    constituent elements were standardized, an infinite range of possible plan
    forms and sections ensured flexibility and 

    responsiveness. Our subsequent analysis hints that the Omani house is unique
    but not alien when compared with other traditional Arab courtyard houses.
    The report is concluded with suggestions for future academic research, while
    our conclusions and recommendations focus on opportunities for practical
    research and development. The premature demise of this house type was partly
    the result of colonization and European interference. It offers valuable
    lessons, however, which could be explored in our quest for better affordable
    housing in Southern and East Africa.

    This article responds to the rapid urbanisation of sub-Saharan Africa. It
    laments the loss and deterioration of its pre-colonial urban artefacts due
    to neglect and even war, and pleads for their conservation and the
    recognition of relevant characteristics as contemporary urban solutions.
    Part one outlines the conceptual framework and highlights four theoretical
    considerations pertaining to definitions, preconceptions, methodology and
    sources of information. Part two contextualises the origins and nature of
    African urbanism with a brief historical perspective. Part three analyses
    the morphology of urban space, while part four concludes by discussing some
    seemingly intrinsic urban characteristics and their compatibility with
    current urban theories. Tipes en tipologiee van Afrika-stedelikheid Hierdie
    artikel reageer op die vinnige verstedeliking van sub-Sahara Afrika. Dit
    betreur die verlies en agteruitgang van sy stedelike artefakte as gevolg van
    verwaarlosing en selfs oorlog, en pleit vir hul bewaring en die erkenning
    van toepaslike eienskappe as hedendaagse stedelike oplossings. Deel een

    wat verband hou met definisies, vooropgesette idees, metodologie en
    inligtingsbronne. Deel twee kontekstualiseer die oorsprong en aard van
    Afrika-stedelikheid met 'n kort historiese oorsig. Deel drie ontleed die
    morfologie van stedelike ruimte, terwyl deel vier afsluit deur 'n aantal
    klaarblyklik intrinsieke stedelike eienskappe en hulle versoenbaarheid met
    hedendaagse stedelike teoriee te bespreek.

  abstract: >-
    Past urban settlements in tropical island environments offer particularly
    challenging sites for mainstream archaeology. Often associated with shallow
    stratigraphic sequences, archaeological sediments and soils in these sites
    are strongly influenced by local geology and seawater. This study discusses
    the advantages and challenges of developing an integrated geoarchaeological
    programme to examine the use of space at the Swahili stonetown of Songo
    Mnara Island, Tanzania. This exceptionally well preserved site, occupied for
    less than two centuries (C14th–16th AD), comprises a complex urban layout
    with stone-built houses, wattle-and-daub structures, funerary complexes,
    activity areas such as wells, and open areas. The programme has combined
    geoarchaeological (soil macro- and micromorphology, ICP-AES, pH, EC),
    geophysical (magnetic susceptibility) and archaeological (large excavations,
    test trenches, artefact distribution mapping) techniques to investigate the
    use of space across different contexts. Initial geoarchaeological
    prospection and opportunistic soil sampling have allowed framing of the
    island’s environmental settings and archaeological deposits as well as
    outlining open spaces in between buildings. Subsequent research applied a
    systematic sampling strategy to map geochemical and artefact distributions
    in conjunction with context-specific soil micromorphology. The results
    provide a means to map out the impact of occupation across the site as well
    as to differentiate between open, roofed and unroofed spaces. ICP-AES
    results, for example, demonstrate that measurements of Ca, Mg, P, S and Sr
    levels can help discriminate occupation/activity areas in tropical island
    environments. They also indicate that the depletion of certain elements
    (e.g. Na, K, and Ni) should be considered as a means of differentiating
    between roofed and unroofed spaces. The combination of different
    methodologies demonstrates the importance of addressing discrepancies as
    well as correlations between multiple datasets for deciphering features
    within urban spaces in tropical environments and interpreting ancient
    activities that occurred within them.

    By juxtaposing case studies from various colonial and postcolonial settings
    from around the world, this edited volume provides a comprehensive and
    diachronic investigation of the ways in which architecture and urban space
    mediate the intersections of colonialism, nationalism, and modernity.
    Besides offering unique historical perspectives on colonialism, nationalism
    and modernity, each case-study also reassesses theories regarding memory and
    monumentalization; the appropriation and deployment of tradition in the
    service of nationalism; and the institutions of modernity.

    Découverte du premier palais royal à Gao et ses implications pour l'histoire
    de l'Afrique de l'OuestThe history of Gao has been reconstructed mainly on
    the basis of the two Tarikhs of Timbuktu. The early days of Gao, however,
    which were not described conscientiously in these Tarikhs, have been
    subjected to polemics in many respects. Our excavations in the
    archaeological sites of Gao Saney and Gao city since 2001 have provided new
    data that offer an original approach for rewriting the early history of Gao.
    According to these data, the archaeological site of Gao Saney was occupied
    by a population including merchants and manufacturers from North Africa from
    the eighth to the tenth centuries, rather than the commonly accepted date of
    the eleventh to the thirteenth centuries, inferred from the epitaphs of the
    neighboring cemetery. Our excavations have also uncovered large buildings
    made completely of stone in Gao city, known as Gao-Ancient. We consider
    these as constituting a royal residence protected by a big castle,
    constructed at the beginning of the tenth century only to be abandoned
    toward the end of the same century. Our excavations have thus confirmed, for
    the first time, the very existence of the twin cities of Gao, mentioned by
    Arabic writers of the tenth and eleventh centuries.

    Colonialism's lasting impact on contemporary African cities has been firmly
    established – yet the ways in which colonial planning practices affected
    walkability, in particular urban permeability in contemporary morphologies,
    have been largely unexplored. High urban permeability supports livelihoods,
    particularly for the urban poor, and is needed for a transition towards more
    walkable cities. Through the mapping of three cities in East Africa, this
    paper demonstrates that cities in which indigenous planning practices were
    able to resist colonial planning practices, the emergent urban form has
    smaller urban blocks and higher urban permeability. As existing policy
    measures on walkability largely avert improvement of urban permeability,
    this study suggest a reassessment of those policies.

  abstract: >-
    In recent years many publications have appeared that stress the sustainable
    character of vernacular architecture, emphasising its ecological
    friendliness and appropriateness. Commonly this literature represents
    vernacular architecture as a more sustainable alternative, or predecessor,
    to conventional contemporary forms of architecture and their associations
    with excessive energy consumption, pollution and wasteful use of resources.
    This article aims to identify what may be learned from this relatively
    recent work in terms of the way in which it conceptualises and represents
    vernacular architecture. It reveals a vibrant and growing discourse that
    makes an important contribution to the field of vernacular architectural
    studies. It also shows, however, that the relative isolation of the
    discourse results in a number of short-comings that make our current
    understanding of the sustainability of vernacular traditions only a partial
    one. Arguing that the recent discourse replaces the complexity, plurality
    and dynamics of both vernacular architecture and the concept of
    sustainability by reductionist, essentialist and romanticist
    representations, the article calls for a holistic, integrated and critical
    approach that complements the study of the environmental qualities and
    performance of vernacular architecture with an examination of its social,
    political and economic aspects. The lessons that are to be found there are
    not so casually learned. Paul Oliver1

  abstract: >-
    In the process of urban development and regeneration, a city always
    gradually derives multiple morphological characteristics from its original
    single form. The transformation of urban form can be viewed as
    representation of consequence of overlapping of cultural attributes, an
    urban quality which is often ignored by property developments. This paper
    addresses that culture is a starting point to analyze traditional urban
    forms of Chinese and Southeast Asian traditional port cities. On the one
    hand, it analyzes their urban morphological characteristics focusing on the
    urban tissue level, which can reflect a process of urban evolution based on
    multi-culture brought by the ancient maritime trade. On the other hand, four
    port cities with similar cultural attributes including Quanzhou and
    Guangzhou in China, Hanoi in Vietnam and Malacca in Malaysia are analyzed
    comparatively to demonstrate their morphological differences and
    similarities. Based on the analysis of the two aspects, the paper recovers
    the relationship between cultural attributes and urban morphology, as well
    as some universal and special rules of urban development.

    Arnhem, cité de rentiers, Wiesbaden, cité de retraités, Düsseldorf, cité des
    banquiers… La liste est longue de villes saisies à un moment historique ou
    au cours d'une période essentielle de leur histoire : La Mecque, Sparte,
    Londres et surtout Venise au temps des Guelfes et des Gibelins. Avec « La
    Ville », Weber excelle dans l’art de la typologie. Il y définit toute une
    gamme de villes « idéaltypiques », selon qu’on les considère sous l’angle
    juridique, économique, politique. Et il le fait avec d’autant plus d’aisance
    que son étonnante érudition lui permet d’interpeller les villes
    babyloniennes, juives, hindoues, islamiques, chinoises ou russes au même
    titre que celles de l’Antiquité grecque ou romaine et celles du Moyen Âge.
    En retraçant l’histoire des conjurations et des corporations, Weber souligne
    l’originalité de l’histoire européenne : la seule à avoir produit la commune
    dans son plein développement. Du même coup, il évoque le rôle moteur du
    christianisme, les transformations du rapport entre la ville et la campagne,
    la nature essentiellement politique des luttes que se livrent les divers
    ordres sociaux, la lente montée de la bourgeoisie. Le passage du capitalisme
    foncier impliquant l’esclavage dans l’Antiquité au capitalisme marchand du
    Moyen Âge n’est jamais qu’une longue série d’étapes d’un processus menant au
    capitalisme moderne et à l’Etat moderne. La Ville, dit Weber, se développe
    selon la logique propre à chaque civilisation, mais il existe en même temps
    une loi interne au champ politique, qui limite le nombre de compromis
    possibles pour faire cohabiter dans une même cité des couches sociales qui
    se distinguent et que leurs intérêts opposent. Les rapports de souveraineté
    et de luttes pour la domination entre villes et Etats sont au cœur de la
    réflexion wébérienne. Aussi, ces analyses gardent-elles une actualité
    manifeste en un temps où les métropoles s’agrandissent et en un temps où,
    avec cet accroissement spatial, démographique et économique, l’acuité des
    problèmes sociaux, environnementaux et politiques se fait plus vive. Max
    Weber (1864-1920), économiste allemand, père de la sociologie contemporaine.

    This study is to explore and examine the sense of place in the Malay world.
    The purpose is to unfold and unveil the aspects and characteristics of what
    and why place is. This study is expected as a contribution to theory of
    landscape design and the built environment. In what extent is the place able
    to carry out and sustain its function and meaning for urbanism? Scrutinizing
    and examining concepts related to the phenomena of building and dwelling
    will be the focus of this essay. The aim is to recognize the sense of place
    for local people observed from planning and design perspective on what they
    call it as home. The study is carried out from the author fieldwork in the
    region from 2010 to 2013. The data were collected with participant
    observation as the author’s life and work experience, supported by literary
    sources.

    This book covers the relationship between societies and their culture in the
    context of traditional settlement in Indonesia. The focus of the study is on
    the search for meanings of local concepts. This study reveals and analyzes
    the concepts concerning home and their sociocultural strategies for
    maintaining a sense of community and identity. In this study, identifying
    local concepts becomes the hallmark and the hub of analyses that explore,
    verify and establish relations between ideas and phenomena. Based on these
    relations, this study attempts to capture the reality of the local world
    that upholds and sustains the communities’ values, norms and principles for
    what they may call a homeland. The book is organized into two parts. Part I
    describes a cross-regional habitation in Indonesia, while Part II presents
    four ethnic regions of Indonesia - Sa’dan Toraja, Bali, Naga and
    Minangkabau. Their unique traditions, customs, beliefs and attitudes serve
    to provide diversity in terms of their backgrounds and lifestyles, though
    they share the challenge of sustaining their sense of home in the face of
    modernity as characterized by changes and developments toward a
    technologically industrialized society. The central research questions are -
    What is development in terms of culture and environmental sustainability?
    How do these communities respond to modernity?

    What are the aspects of daily urbanism in the West Malay world that work for
    place-making? Despite the difficulties for defining its boundary and
    content, this study argues that urbanite characteristics are potential
    structure and function of what place-making is. Such characteristics are
    recognizable from the phenomena of proximate, diverse, and intricate
    habitation. Accordingly, the phenomena show themselves as the urban
    life-world in the form of everyday life activities, either as formal or
    casual activities. Daily urbanism demonstrates, performs, and holds people
    in specific domains, environments, and events with various concentrations,
    interactions, and communications of people and things. The task of the study
    is to explore and analyze the aspects of habitation that potentially work
    for place-making in the Malaysian towns and cities. The main material of the
    study was carried out from the author’s fieldwork in the region from 2010 to
    2013.

    This book raises the issue of the practice of patrimonial power with a focus
    on habitations, particularly in the urban areas of Indonesia. An assemblage
    of interdisciplinary studies within the framework of environmental
    humanities, covering the arts, architecture, urban studies, geography,
    cultural anthropology, and sociology, this multifaceted framework divulges
    the interactive connectivity between Indonesia's patrimonial culture and the
    socio-culturally constructed system of habitation. The interdisciplinary
    study of the pertinent practices of patrimonial power that have been
    represented and been manifested by various political and traditional regimes
    in terms of the built environment and habitation in Indonesia contributes to
    a new understanding of Indonesian urban spatial development, from the
    pre-colonial era to the present. The book poses that in order to understand
    the politics of Indonesia, one must understand the culture and tradition of
    the political leadership of the country. The author presents such an
    understanding in exploring and unpacking the relationship between people and
    place that constructs, develops, sustains, and conserves Indonesian culture
    and traditions of habitation. This book is of interest to graduate scholars
    and researchers in Asian Studies in numerous disciplines, including urban
    studies, urban planning and design, political science, architecture,
    anthropology of space, public administration, and political philosophy

    What is the urbanism of Malacca? The question leads this study to the
    exploration of the relationship between patrimonialism and multicultural
    urbanism in the Malay Peninsular world. The data of this study are compiled
    from literary survey and author’s fieldworks in the city of Malacca and
    other towns in the Malay Peninsula between 2010 and 2013. The body of
    knowledge of this study is constructed by scrutinizing and examining local
    concepts, morphological aspects, structures, patterns, and attributes of
    settlement that matter for urbanism. Notwithstanding the urban form in the
    peninsula changes from pre-colonial to modern times, this study argues that
    the reality of its urban characters remains similar because its concept is
    based on the relatively unaffected patrimonial multiculturalism.

    What is the relationship between political culture and urbanism in West
    Malaysia? How do political forces work that plan, build, develop, and
    sustain urban settlement in the Malay Peninsula landscape? The questions
    lead this study to investigate aspects of formation, configuration,
    organization, and transformation of domains that include indigenous ordering
    framework and modern planning system in this former British colonialized
    country. The focus of this study is to explore the political history of
    multicultural urbanism and the practices of patrimonial culture in West
    Malaysian towns, cities, and regions.

    Houses are an important subject of archaeological research, normally
    explored through the households they contain. This has established a
    deliberately social agenda for the archaeology of houses, yet has had the
    unintended consequence of creating bounded worlds for study. Although
    household archaeologies explore the ways that households contributed to
    broader social and economic realms, it is rare to think through the public
    role of houses for non-residents and the larger population of the
    settlement. This paper seeks to explore this more public aspect of houses
    using the data from archaeology at Songo Mnara, a 14th–15th century Swahili
    town on the southern Tanzanian coast. This was a time when stone-built
    domestic architecture was first emerging in this region. The archaeology of
    the houses provides data for a series of ways that the house was at the
    heart of the economic and political life of the town, as well as
    demonstrating a spatial continuity between indoor and outdoor spaces. It is
    therefore suggested that the domestic and residential functions of the house
    for a particular household should be balanced with an appreciation of the
    broader world of the house itself.

    Urban communities on the medieval East African coast have been previously
    discussed in terms of ethnicity and migration. Here assemblages from coastal
    towns and from surface survey in the interior are used to paint a different
    picture of urban (Swahili) origins. The author shows that coast and interior
    shared a common culture, but that coastal sites grew into ‘stonetowns’
    thanks to the social impact of imports: the material culture structured the
    society.
